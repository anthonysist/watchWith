*About This App*

This app is intended to be a simple, unique way to exprience video content internally.

By utilizing a node server, Websockets and Angular, I am trying to build an app that will alow you to start a 'room', and play and embedded youtube video along with anyone else in the room, in realtime.

We love watching youtube video, no matter the subject, among ourselves, but sometimes it's more fun to share cool videos and expreience them with your teammates in realtime.

*Implementation*

Eventually, I would like to test Web-RTC to place a live video/audio chat feed of the various users or the room owner, possibly to facilitate discussion of whatever we are watching.

This is wholly incomplete, the basic structue is barely in place.
